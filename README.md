mantisrb [![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/klauern/mantisrb.png)](http://travis-ci.org/klauern/mantisrb)
========

`mantisrb` is an API that works with the [Savon][1] gem to talk to a [Mantis][2]
bug tracker through SOAP calls.  Mantis' SOAP interface is called [MantisConnect][3]
(see [example][4] for an API view).

Usage
-----
Install:

``` ruby
gem install mantisrb
```

Create a session to the Mantis server:

```ruby
session = Mantis::Session.new "http://mantisurl.com/mantis", "YourUsername", "YourPassword", "(optional) HTTP Username", "(optional) HTTP Password"
```

Various components are described below:

Config
------
Configuration details about the Mantis installation can be retrieved, such
as finding out the status types, access levels, and view states:

```ruby
session.config.priorities # get priorities
session.config.statuses # possible issue statuses
session.config.version # Mantis version
session.config.access_levels
```

More information on this can be found in {Mantis::Config}.

Projects
--------
Get a list of projects that your user can access:

```ruby
    session.projects.list
```

Create a project:

```ruby
    project_id = session.projects.create params={
      name: "project name"  # Minimally, this is all you need
    }
```

Or provide more details (some shown below):

```ruby
    project = session.projects.create {
      name: "project thing",
      status: "development"
      enabled: true,
      view_state: :public # or 'public', or session.projects.status.public,
      inherit_from_global: true
    }

    project.name  # "project thing"
    project.id    # 10 or whatever for referencing
    project......
```

More details on what is in a project can be found in {Mantis::XSD::ProjectData}.

Issues
------
Getting issues is easy, too:

by id:

```ruby
    session.issues.by_id 110 # if you know the id
    session.issues.exists? 110 # if you don't know if it's there
    session.issues.by_name "problem name I solved" # name of Mantis issue that
    you want to search explicitly by (no wildcards or regex'ing, sorry)

    session.projects.issues "project name" # get first 100 issues by Project Name
```

by ugly Mantis summary searching:

```ruby
    session.issues.summary_matches "some regex"  # Do some ssearching (mind, it
    is going to be pretty slow)
```

by project id:

```ruby
    session.issues.by_project_id project_id, page_#, issues_per_page # The
    fully flexible way of getting a list of issues
    session.issues.by_project_id project_id # gets you an Enumerable to go
    through things
    session.issues.by_project_id project_id, limit # number of issues to get at
    once
```

Creating them isn't too bad (know your options):

```ruby
    issue = session.issues.create {
      summary: "issue description somewhere here",
      priority: :high,
      due_date: "10/13/2011 08:45 AM" # or other formats as DateTime will
      accept
    }
```

Required fields for an issue:
  - project (`id` or `name` of project will work)
  - summary
  - description
  - category name (you can get this from the project)
    

Information on what is in an Issue can be found in the {Mantis::XSD::IssueData}
class.

### Issue Check-in

Issues can be updated with comments or completion with this quick call to an
issue:

```ruby
    session.issues.checkin(issue_id, comment, completed?) # defaults to false
```

There are a number of other features that you can manipulate through the API,
so check out the documentation for more.  See {Mantis::Issues} for more
information on the other types (relationships, attachments, etc.)

Filters
-------
Filters are Mantis' way of saving a configured search.  You likely know what
they are if you have used Mantis, so if not, please take a brief look at [this
blogpost][6] to see what you can use filters for.


Get a filter by `id`:

```ruby
    session.filters.by_project_id 110 # get all filters you can search by for the project_id
```

Get issues for a particular filter:

```ruby
    session.filters.get_issues project_id # get first 100 issues for a given
    filter
    session.filters.get_issues project_id, page_num, issues_per_page
    # fully-formatted search
```

Creation/Deletion/Etc., actions on Filters are unsupported as Mantis' SOAP API
does not support it.

Categories in Projects
----------------------
When creating issues, you will need to know what category the issue belongs to, so this should be
helpful.

Get all categories for a project:

```ruby
    session.projects.categories(project_id)
```

Add a category

```ruby
    session.projects.add_category(45, "Triage")
    session.projects.add_category(<project_id>, <category_name>)
```

Delete a category


```ruby
    session.projects.delete_category(<project_id>, <category_name>)
```

Rename a category


```ruby
    session.projects.rename_category params={
      project_id: <id>,
      old_category: <category_name>,
      new_category: <new_category_name>,
      project_assigned_to: <id> # leaving this out will keep it in the same
      project
    }
```



Compatibility
-------------
You can see which environments have been tested on [Travis CI][travis].  JRuby support 
is lacking, as it appears there might be an issue with [Nokogiri][nok] and 
[Savon][sav] gems (to be determined).  Any help in getting JRuby to work (w/
JRUBY_OPTS=--1.9) would be greatly appreciated.


License, Open-Source-ness, and other Miscellany
===============================================
I've licensed `mantisrb` with the [MIT License][5], which should be permissive
enough for you to muck around and fiddle with.  It's open-source, so
contributions are welcomed and encouraged.

For any questions / suggestions / contributions, contact me at:

Email: klauer - at - gmail - dot - com for more information or send me a pull-request.


Bugs/Issues/TODO's
==================
There are alot of things I don't have done in this, but you should be able to
get by for the most part with:

  * querying projects/issues/filters, etc
  * CRUD tasks on issues/projects/filters/categories, etc.


What isn't done:
----------------

  * Mocking - I have yet to get mocking to work on this project, and I could
    use someone's help in getting that up.  That would make finishing the
    testing SOOO much easier.
  * Testing - I have a long way to go


What can't be done:
------------------
Unfortunately, MantisConnect just isn't as full-featured as their web
application.  If you want feature parity with Mantis, I have yet to find an API
that will work with it, besides attempting to stub out all of the calls that
are normally performed from the browser in an API, or possibly hard-wiring your
application into the Mantis Database tables.

I have at a minimum, implemented every method call that MantisConnect provides.
If `mantisrb` doesn't provide something, it's probably not in their SOAP API.
